# BookApp
===============================================================================================

### Description ###
This sample app was built using MVVM architecture where I have used clean architecture, Jetpack compose, coroutine, Solid Principle, coin image rendering library, and Hilt dependency Framework.

The "BookApp" is a mobile application designed to provide users with a seamless experience of exploring and discovering books. The app has two primary screens: a book listing screen and a book detail screen.

Book Listing Screen:
The book listing screen is the initial landing page of the app. Each book is represented as a card or item, displaying essential information such as the book's title, author(s), cover image, and potentially a brief description. Users can scroll through the list to view various books and get a sense of what's available.

Key features and elements of the book listing screen:

* List of books: Displayed as a list, showcasing multiple books simultaneously.
* Book cards/items: Each book card includes details like the title, author(s), and cover image.
* Clickable items: Users can tap on a book card to navigate to the book detail screen.
* Loading indicators: Displayed when fetching book data from a remote source.
* Error handling: Shows an error message if there's an issue with loading the book data.
* Internet connectivity check: Notifies users if their device isn't connected to the internet.

Book Detail Screen:
The book detail screen provides users with comprehensive information about a specific book they've selected from the book listing screen. This screen allows users to delve deeper into the details of the chosen book, helping them make informed decisions about whether to read or purchase it.

Key features and elements of the book detail screen:

* Book cover image: Displayed prominently at the top to give users a visual representation of the book.
* Title and subtitle: Presents the book's main title along with any available subtitles.
* Author(s): Lists the author(s) responsible for the book.
* Publisher and publication date: Provides information about the book's publisher and when it was published.
* Description: Offers a brief overview of the book's content.
* Rating and reviews: Displays the average rating and potentially the number of reviews from readers.
* Navigation options: Users can return to the book listing screen or perform other actions.
* Error handling and loading indicators: Similar to the book listing screen, there might be loading indicators and error messages.

I develop to do this in Kotlin way. Excited and long way to go from here.
